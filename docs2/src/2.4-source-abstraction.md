# Source Abstraction

Before advancing further, let's talk about source abstraction. I have used sql::Table together
with postgres(), lets talk about it.

sql::Table::new() expects two arguments - &str name of the table and struct that implements
sql::Source trait. There are several implementations:

- sql::Postgres
- sql::Sqlite
- sql::MySql

Together with sql::Table - source implementations will work to construct a vendor-specific query
and execute it. Generally those rely on sqlx and a custom query builder, however it's not important
to know at this point.

```rust
use vantage::sql::Postgres;
use anyhow::Resust;

static POSTGRESS: OnceLock<Postgres> = OnceLock::new();

pub fn set_postgres(postgres: Postgres) -> Result<()> {
    POSTGRESS
        .set(postgres)
        .map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!("Failed to set Postgres instance: {:?}", e))
}

pub fn postgres() -> Postgres {
    POSTGRESS
        .get()
        .expect("Postgres has not been initialized. use connect_postgress()")
        .clone()
}

pub async fn connect_postgres() -> Result<()> {
    let connection_string = std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| "postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/postgres".to_string());

    let postgres = Postgres::new(&connection_string).await;
    set_postgres(postgres)
}
```

In my application code - I will initialize a postgres instance at the start of my application. I
can then clone it and use it to create new sql::Table instances.
