# The DataSet Trait

DataSet is a Rust Trait:

```rust
pub trait DataSet: ReadableDataSet + WriteableDataSet {}
```

DataSet has various implementations:

```rust
impl DataSet for sql::Table {
    // Implementation details
}
impl DataSet for csv::File {
    // Implementation details
}
```

Obviously there may be more implementations of DataSet, but in this book I'll cover those two.

When you work on your application you will generally know if the data you wish to work with would
be stored in SQL or CSV. Let's define a DataSet for Client using sql::Table:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, PartialEq, Default)]
struct Client {
    id: i32,
    name: String,
    is_vip: bool,
}
impl Entity for Client {}
```

This makes it possible to use Client in conjunction with `sql::Table`:

```rust
let clients = sql::Table::new("clients", postgres());
for client in clients.with_entity::<Client>().iter().await? {
    println!("{:?}", client.name);
}
```

A `sql::Table` implementation will need a clone of postgres() source and to know name of the table.
We can also specify an `entity` for `sql::Table`, which associates our data set with a Rust type.

Lets clean things up a bit by creating a custom `fn table()`:

```rust
impl Client {
    fn table() -> sql::Table<Postgres, Client> {
        Table::new("client", postgres()).with_entity()
    }
}

for client in Client::table().iter().await? {
    println!("{:?}", client.name);
}
```

If you also want to read Client from a CSV file, you can define Client::csv():

```rust
impl Client {
    fn csv() -> csv::File<Client> {
        File::new("clients.csv").with_entity()
    }
}
```

Finally lets create a function which would work with both Client::table() and Client::csv():

```rust
async fn print_clients<T>(clients: T)
where
    T: ReadableDataSet<Item = Client>
{
    for client in clients.iter().await? {
        println!("{:?}", client.name);
    }
}


async fn main() {
    print_clients(Client::table()).await;
    print_clients(Client::csv()).await;
}
```
