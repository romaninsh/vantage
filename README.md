# Vantage

[![Book](https://github.com/romaninsh/vantage/actions/workflows/book.yaml/badge.svg)](https://romaninsh.github.io/vantage/)

Vantage is an **Entity Framework** for Rust. With Vantage you can represent
your business entities (Client, Order, Invoice, Lead) with native Rust types. Business
logic implementation in Vantage and Rust is type-safe and is very ergonomic for large
code-bases.

Given a sample entity `struct Client { .. }`, your business code can operate with:

- `ReadableDataSet<Client>` - An arbitrary Database, CSV files or API can implement this trait - allowing to read `Client` records from remote DataSource.
- `Insertable<Client>` - Queue iterfaces, JSONP files and other
- `WritableDataSet<Client>` - Patch(update), Replace or Delete remote operations
- `DataSet<Client>` - Trait that implements 3 of the above operations.

DataSet represents collection of records stored remotely. In practice DataSets are usually massive and can
contain millions of records. This is a typical Enterprise use-case:

```rust
// Implemented in shared Business Model Library

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Default)]
struct Client {
    name: String,
    email: String,
    is_paying_client: bool,
    balance: Decimal,
}

impl Client {
    fn new(){ /* ... */};

    fn registration_queue() -> impl Insertable<Client> {}
    fn admin_api() -> impl DataSet<Client> {}
    fn read_csv(filename: String) -> impl ReadableDataSet<Client> {}
    fn mock() -> MockDataSet<Client> {}
}

/////////////////////////////////////////
// In any of your 1000s microservices:

use model::Client;

async fn register_new_client(client: Client) -> Result<()> {
    let queue = Client::registration_queue(); // Probably KafkaTopic<Client>
    let id = uuid::Uuid::new_v4().to_string(); // Idempotent ID generation
    queue.insert(id, client).await
}
```

Enterprise software employes hundreds of developers, and anyone can make use of type
safety, without knowing implementation details. In example above - individual engineers
do not need to know if `registration_queue()` is implemented by Kafka topic, SQL or Rest API,
interface in SDK remains the same.

## Vantage features

Introduction above covered 3% of entire Vantage features set. Framework consist of over 10
crates and implementing a wide range of features like:

- Standard CRUD operations with persistence-abstraction
- Implementation of DataSource-specific extensions
- Implementation of Entity-specific extensions
- Support for Expressions and Query Builder pattern (SQL, SurrealDB)
- MultiModal and Json database support (Mongo, GraphQL, SurrealDB)
- Data Source abstractions (CSV, Excel, PubSub, APIs)
- DataSet building - conditions, query-based expressions and delayed condition lookup
- Sync Relationship/References traversal - one-many and many-many - including cross-persistence.
- Generic types for DataSet, Table and ActiveRecord over Entity
- Support for standard and extended types on table columns
- Column flags
- (coming in 0.3) Column mapping, validation
- Typed queries (known result type) and associated queries (can self-execute)
- Type-erased structs for all major traits
- Adaptors for UI frameworks, APIs (like axum)
- (planned in 0.3) Aggregation, Joins, Expressions.
- Yaml-based Entity configurator
- Powerful Error handling

## Type erasure support

Rust type system is amazing and it is at the core of all Vantage features. In
some cases, we want to erase types, for example if we require a generic type
interface.

Vantage provides a full set of "Any\*" types, which can be used like this:

```rust
let clients = Client::admin_api(); // impl DataSet<Client>
let clients = AnyDataSet::new(clients); // AnyDataSet - types erased.

let entities: = vec![clients, orders, ..];
```

Once type is erased - you can store different entities in same data-structure,
implement cross-language SDKs. If you are interested in "Any\*" types,
see Documentation. The rest of the README will focus on fully typed
primitives.

## DataSet operations

Crate `vantage-dataset` introduces ImTableSource, implementing in-memory
DataSet implementation.

```rust
let in_memory_cache = ImDataSource::new();

let client_cache = ImTable::<User>::new(&in_memory_cache, "clients");
let clients.import(Client::read_csv("clients.csv")).await?;

// Basic loading operation - load one client record
let (id, client) = clients.load_some().await?;
// Next - delete it from memory
clients.delete_id(&id).await?;
// Insert it back
clients.insert_id(id, client).await?;
```

The above operation will work consistently with ANY data-set implementation.
If you switch to `let clients = Client::admin_api()` the rest of your code
remain un-changed, because both `ImTable` and `admin_api()` impl `DataSet<>`

## Type casting and Value Sets

Some record types can be incredibly complex. Vantage assumes that any entity
can be represented through various types. Next example may fetch only the
"name" field from admin_api (if API supports this):

```rust
struct MiniClient {
    name: String,
}
let just_name = Client::admin_api()
    .get_id_as::<MiniClient>(client_id)
    .await?
    .name;
```

DataSet has no mandatory fields. Sometimes you don't want to use types
at all. For this situation, Vantage has full support for `serde_json::Value`:

```rust
let just_name = Client::admin_api()
    .get_id_value(client_id)
    .await?
    .get("name")?;
```

If you want to learn more about `ValueSet` - you can find more info in the documentation.

## Table

`Table<>` type implemented in `vantage-table` crate brings a crucial type into Vantage:

```rust
impl Client {
    fn table() -> Table<Client, Oracle>;
}
impl Order {
    fn table() -> Table<Order, MongoDB>;
}
```

Lets start by looking at the core features of Table:

- Table has Columns
- Table can be filtered
- Table can be ordered
- Table can paginate

To maximize performance, Table will always try to use DataBase capabilities to implement
above features, and retrieve data once it's filtered, ordered and paginated.

```rust
let mut order = Order::table();
order.add_condition(order.is_deleted().eq(false));
order.set_order_by(order.created_at().desc());
order.set_pagination(Pagination::ipp(25));

// filters, sorts and paginates on-the-server
for (id, order) in order.get().await? {
    dbg!(order);
}
```

Table can be cloned and all the above methods support builder-pattern:

```rust
let orders = Order::table();
for (id, order) in Order::table()
  .with_condition(order.is_deleted().eq(false))
  .with_order_by(order.created_at().desc())
  .with_pagination(Pagination::ipp(25))
  .get().await?
{
    dbg!(order);
}
```

## TableSource

Previous example created `order` table like this:

```rust
let order: Table<Order, MongoDB>
```

If MongoDB `impl DataSource`, then Vantage implements `DataSet<E>` for
`Table<E, _: TableSource>` automatically. In other words - any table
implements `DataSet` and `ValueSet` traits automatically.

Lets populate our In-memory cache from MongoDB:

```rust
let mongo_orders = Order::table(); // Table<Order, MongoDB>
let mongo_orders = mongo_orders
    .with_condition(mongo_orders.is_deleted().eq(false));
let im_orders = ImTable::<Order>::new(&in_memory_cache, "orders");

im_orders.import(&mongo_orders).await?;
```

Software engineres love consistency, and Vantage delivers consistency!

## SelectSource and Queries

Relatonal databases - SQL or SurrealDB use powerful query languages to
perform even more operations inside the database. `vantage-expressions`
implement a building blocks for Query Builders. Crates `vantage-surrealdb`
and `vantage-sql` provide implementation for Query Builder as well as
ability to execute those queries:

```rust
impl SelectSource for SurrealDB {
    type Select<E: Entity> = SurrealSelect;

    fn select<E: Entity>(&self) -> Self::Select<E>;
    async fn execute_select<E: Entity>(&self, select: &Self::Select<E>) -> Result<Vec<E>>;
}

impl Selectable for SurrealSelect { .. }
```

Vantage understands that Databases have different SQL dialects or even
entirely different query languages. As with other things, Vantage
expects all Query Builders to implement some bare minimum - `impl Selectable`.

In our example, Organisation stores `Client` in SurrealDB - but that is
not a database that most developers are familiar with.

Vantage query builder interface breaches this gap. Here is how we can
calculate `SELECT SUM(balance) from client where is_paying_client = true`
in SurrealQL:

```rust
let clients = Client::table();
let clients = clients.with_condition(clients.is_paying_client().eq(true));

// SurrealSelect<result::Rows>
let query = clients.select();

// SurrealReturn
let sum_query = query.as_sum(clients.balance());

// Preview query
println!("Sum query: {}", sum_query.preview());

// Execute query and Convert Value into Decimal
let sum: Decimal = sum_query.get().await?.into();
```

The code listed here will work just as well if Client table would be stored
in Oracle. Vantage makes it very easy for organisation to move entities between
persistences without changing code and without sacrifice in performance.

## Expressions

While we look into Queries, I should also explain Expressions. Implementing
Query builder dialects with Vantage is easy, because you rely on Expression engine.
In Vantage expression engine is composable and supports parameters:

```rust
let now = if Some(date) = cutoff_date {
    expr!("{}", date)
} else {
    expr!("now()")
}
let condition = expr!("expires_at < {}", now);
let delete = expr!("DELETE FROM clients WHERE {}", condition);

// Prints: DELETE FROM clients WHERE expires_at < now() -- 0 parameters
// or DELETE FROM clients WHERE expires_at < $1  ($1 = '2024-06-01T00:00:00Z' )
println!("Delete query: {}", delete.preview());
```

Other query languages will struggle with variable number of parameters,
and will outright make it impossible to compose expressions from chunks.

Vantage additionally support **deferred expressions** - a way to create
query across multiple databases without async code.

## Deferred Expressions

Suppose you have 2 databases. Both support queries, but otherwise incompatible.
How do you construct a query like this:

```sql
select sum(vat) from MYSQL.orders where order.country_code in (
    select country_code from POSTGRES.countries where is_eu = true
)
```

Without Vantage you would query PostgreSQL first, await, fetch, insert
result into MySQL query, fetch await etc.

Vantage allows you to build query `sync` then query/fetch `async`:

```rust
let eu_countires = expr!("SELECT country_code FROM countries WHERE is_eu = true");
let eu_countries = postgres.defer(&eu_countires);

let vat_sum = expr!("SELECT SUM(vat) FROM orders WHERE country_code IN {}", eu_countries);
let vat_sum = mysql.query(&vat_sum).await?; // <-- single await!
```

But why would you operate with expressions, when you have query builders?

```rust
let eu_countries = postgres
    .select()
    .with_source(expr!("countries"))
    .with_field("country_code".to_string());

let vat_sum = mysql
    .select()
    .with_source(expr!("orders"))
    .with_expression(expr!("SUM(vat)", Some("total_vat".to_string()))
    .with_condition(expr!("country_code in {}', postgrs.defer(&eu_countries)))
    .get().await?; // <-- single await!
```

Why is this important? Because `Table<>` can encapsulate the above logic, hiding it's implementation
away inside the data model, exposing the interface like this:

```rust
let eu_orders = Orders::table().only_eu_orders(); // add_condition(expr)
let vat_sum = eu_orders.select().as_sum(eu_orders.vat()).get().await?;
```

## Expressionable

In Vantage - many different things can be part of Expression. You aready have seen
date and whatever `defer()` returns as part of expression. Any struct that implements
Expressionable can be and this includes:

- Table columns: `eu_orders.vat()`
- Opeartions: `clients.is_paying_client().eq(true)`
- Sort order: `clients.name().desc()`
- Queries: `other_table.select()`
- Query builder components: `Identifier`, `Field`, `JoinQuery`, `SurrealReturn` or `Thing`
- Closure - that's what `defer()` returns after all.
- Scalar values - int, string, etc - those become parameters

Of course you can implement more types and even your own unique Expresison engines making
them compatible. As example - MongoDB has expression engine that results in JSON strings.

## Advanced Query Building

> WARNING: Vantage 0.2 code, could be incompatible with 0.3

In Vantage query builders implement `Selectable` trait - to make it familiar to
developers, however SQL query builder much more powerful and allow to build any query
using Rust:

```rust

let github_authors_and_teams = Query::new()
    .with_table("dx_teams", Some("t".to_string()))
    .with_field("team_source_id".to_string(), expr!("t.source_id"));

// Team is an anchestor
let github_authors_and_teams = github_authors_and_teams.with_join(query::JoinQuery::new(
    query::JoinType::Inner,
    query::QuerySource::Table("dx_team_hierarchies".to_string(), Some("h".to_string())),
    query::QueryConditions::on().with_condition(expr!("t.id = h.ancestor_id")),
));

// to a user with `user_name`
let github_authors_and_teams = github_authors_and_teams
    .with_join(query::JoinQuery::new(
        query::JoinType::Inner,
        query::QuerySource::Table("dx_users".to_string(), Some("dxu".to_string())),
        query::QueryConditions::on().with_condition(expr!("h.descendant_id = dxu.team_id")),
    ))
    .with_field("user_name".to_string(), expr!("dxu.name"))
    .with_field("github_username".to_string(), expr!("dxu.source_id"));
```

(Full example: <https://github.com/romaninsh/vantage/blob/main/bakery_model/examples/3-query-builder.rs>)

## Table References

Vantage does not use term "relations" and instead uses "references". Defined like this:

```rust
let client = Client::table();
let client = client.with_many("orders", "client_id", || Box::new(Order::table()));

pub trait ClientTable {
    fn ref_orders(&self) -> Table<Order, SurrealDB> {
        self.get_ref_as("orders").unwrap()
    }
}
impl ClientTable for Table<Client, SurrealDB> {}
```

relationship can be traversed - transforming one table anto another. In Vantage traversal
is also `sync` and will just modify conditions:

```rust
let client_john = client.clone().with_condition(client.name().eq("John Doe"));
let johns_orders = client_john.ref_orders();
// Table<Order, SurrealDB>
```

As you can probably guess - Vantage allow you to traverse references across persistences
as well and that happens transparently, without change to model API.

Reference methods do not necessarily have to return Table, they can also respond with
DataSet or even something more specific like ReadableDataSet.

## Associated Records

Up to this point, we have mostly looked at DataSets and Tables. They represent multiple
records, but sometimes you want to operate with a single record.

In Vantage for this purpose have yet another type: Record<> and RecordTable trait.
Standard table implementation implements this trait already:

```rust
let john_table = client.clone().with_condition(client.name().eq("John Doe"));

// Record<Client, Table<Client, SurrealDB>>
let mut john = john_table.get_some_record();
john.email = "john@example.com";
john.save().await?;
```

With Record, you don't need to store ID. Record has all the methods you implement for
Client, and in addition offers `id()` and `save()`.

Record must not outlive a `WritableDataSet` where it must save itself, but you
have some amazing flexibility with this. For instance you can load record from cache,
but save it into persistent table.

## Mock Testing

Testing business logic is inherently difficult. As a result - business logic test is
done in the **integration tests**, relies on database snapshots and is very slow.

Vantage introduces mocks at the SDK level and therefore business logic can be tested
at **unit test** level, without any external dependencies. This is much faster and
will speed up your CI pipelines, making engineers more productive.

## UI and API Adaptors

Vantage has a crate `vantage-ui-adapters` which has a referenec integration with 6
different Rust UI frameworks:

- Cursive
- EGui
- GPUI
- RatatUI
- Slint
- Tauri

The goal of adapters is to create a UI Table around Vantage Table. Similarly there is
integration with Axum (see `bakery_api` crate) - which can be a great example of
building generic REST APIs for your `DataSets`. It should also be possible to implement
A more sophisticated API such as GraphQL API for Tables (but that would be a 3rd party crate).

## Table Columns

Table Columns type is defined by TableSource, so for SurrealDB Vantage uses SurrealColumn.
This technically allows to have Vendor-specific Column extensions.

Additionally Columns support flags, which is a feature aimed at generic UI builders. For further
information on this - check Any\* documentation.

## Using Vantage with Axum

Vantage fits well into Axum helping you build API handlers:

```rust
async fn list_orders(
    client: axum::extract::Query<OrderRequest>,
    pager: axum::extract::Query<Pagination>,
) -> impl IntoResponse {
    let orders = Client::table()
        .with_id(client.client_id.into())
        .ref_orders();

    let mut query = orders.query();

    // Tweak the query to include pagination
    query.add_limit(Some(pager.per_page));
    if pager.page > 0 {
        query.add_skip(Some(pager.per_page * pager.page));
    }

    // Actual query happens here!
    Json(query.get().await.unwrap())
}
```

API response for `GET /orders?client_id=2&page=1`

```json
[
  { "client_id": 2, "client_name": "Doc Brown", "id": 2, "total": 220 },
  { "client_id": 2, "client_name": "Doc Brown", "id": 3, "total": 995 }
]
```

## Roadmap

Vantage needs a bit more work. Large number of features is already implemented, but
some notable features are still missing:

- Joins - were present in 0.2, but not yet implemented in 0.3 (read and write)
- Live Table - Mutexed table with real-time updates
- Aggregate columns - were in 0.2, but not yet implemented in 0.3
- Column hooks - allowing field mappings and custom calculation is still TODO.
- Cleanups - still missing some Any\* types.
- Interface consistency - more methods must return (id, E) tuple.
- SQL testing - most tests so far were done with SurrealDB. We should give SQL more love.
- Type support for SQL
- Oracle, because why not!
- Graph relations - implement hasMany support for Graph databases
- More love for Mongo
- Consider Neq4ql crate
- Implement some RestAPI adaptors (e.g. GitLab)
- Aggregators (grouping queries) for SQL and SurrealDB

## Installation
